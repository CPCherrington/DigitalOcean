Installing Laravel on your Digital Ocean Droplet.

First we need to create a new droplet via Digital Ocean, Look for the LAMP 14.04 one click app and create it.
Next we will SSH into this newly created droplet. Your username by default will be root and digital ocean will email you your password.

Next once you have successfully SSH'ed into your server we will need to ensure everything is updated
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Next we will want to enable Apache mod_rewrite module
sudo a2enmod rewrite

Now we will install composer so we can pull in all of laravels dependencies
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

Next we will install MCrypt for PHP5
sudo apt-get install mcrypt php5-mcrypt
sudo php5enmod mcrypt

Now restart Apache
sudo service apache2 restart

Now we will sort out our Mcrypt files so they point to all the right locations
sudo updatedb 
locate mcrypt.ini (Should show it located at /etc/php5/mods-available)
locate mcrypt.so (Should show it located at /usr/lib/php5/20121212/mcrypt.so)

Now we want to edit the mcrypt.ini file and change the extension to match the path to mcrypt.so
(extension=/usr/lib/php5/20121212/mcrypt.so) for example
now run
sudo php5enmod mcrypt

Verify files exist
ls -al /etc/php5/cli/conf.d/20-mcrypt.ini
ls -al /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/20-mcrypt.ini

Now restart Apache
sudo service apache2 restart

Now restart php5 or php5-fpm
sudo service php5 restart

Now we want to install Laravel onto our server
first run the following to eliminate the memory issue..
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=512k
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile

Next cd into your root folder
cd /var/www/

now run
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel PROJECTNAME "5.2.*"

go into your www folder and change the permissions
sudo chmod -R gu+w www
sudo chmod -R guo+w www

Now we will want to change the root directory to point to the correct place
find the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default file and nano into it

now edit the file and change the DocumentRoot to:
/var/www/PROJECTNAME/public

Now change the Directory to /var/www/PROJECTNAME

Now restart your Apache once more
sudo service apache2 restart

NOW YOUR LARAVEL PROJECT IS UP AND RUNNING - GOTO YOUR IP URL AND CHECK IT OUT!!!
